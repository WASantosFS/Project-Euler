##Summary
The point of this project is to simply provide a fun yet challenging way to work on web API interaction with a website. Through the solving of the problems, more and more content will have to be handled.

##To Do
-[ ] Solve problems in an OOP way.
-[ ] Create client-side call to URL.
-[ ] Create web page.
-[ ] 

### Ideas
* https://projecteuler.net/minimal=# isn't authorized or authenticated it seems. When the # is replaced with a number, it pulls up the problem in HTML format. This can be used to not necessarily have to write the problem out again -- or have to store it somewhere. Instead -- at least for a console app -- the user would select a problem by the number and then it would make a call to that address to display the wording of the problem then also display an option to give it a different set of figures, if possible.
